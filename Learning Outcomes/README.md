Back-end

![structure](../Media/layers.jpg)

As seen above I have used multiple layers to structure my API. In the Image below you can see how which layer is dependent on which.

![controller](../Media/controller.jpg)

Above you can see how my controller is structured. It also has custom return messages. I have decided to build my back-end using the c# language because I had previous experience making an API in c# in the GroupProject.

![swagger](../Media/Screenshot%202022-06-13%20113710.jpg)

In the picture above you can see that i have used Swagger UI for the documentation of my API. Because it saves me a lot of time for API documentation. And is comprehensible for developers and non-developers.

__Software Quality__

For this learning outcome I made automated tests for my API. I also used the automatically generated SQL Database which is stored locally as my test database to test Integration and Unit tests.

1. Unit Testing

2. Integration Testing
3. Automated Testing
4. Merge Checks / SonarCloud
